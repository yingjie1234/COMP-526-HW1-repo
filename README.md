# COMP-526-HW1-repo

Welcome!  This repository is part of my COMP 526 homework.  
I’m experimenting with **Git** and **GitHub** features here.

## What I’ve Done
- Created a public repo
- Practiced commits & pushes
- Styled this README with Markdown

## Example Commands
```bash
git status
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with markdown"
git push

```
